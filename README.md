# cnc-relay
During a red team exercise it's common to set up a relaying infrastructure to seperate your external facing footprint from the actual command and control backend. Some of the popular light-weight options are to set up either HAProxy or NGINX on disposable cloud infrastructure and proxy traffic to an internal and/or secured host where an operator has access to the command and control framework. Even though this setup works in most cases, metadata such as the original source IP of a beacon is lost.

This repository contains two docker environments that allows you to set up an example Command and Control environment with relays but still retain the original source IP of a beacon. More details can be found on my blogpost @ https://www.d3vzer0.com/retain-beacon-source-ip-with-haproxy-relays/
